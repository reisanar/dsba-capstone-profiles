**Project Title:** Twitter Political Sentiment

**Solo Dolo**:
- Kahlil Wehmeyer

This app was created with the intention of getting a better understanding of the sentiment towards and surronding presedential candidates of the 2020 election for the Unites States of America.

This app is, in a way, tracking the candidate popularity. Favorite and retweet counts are a somewhat reasonable measure of how the public feels about a candidates message.

** Undergraduate Completion Rates: ** Jarrod Merriman

The purpose of this project is to build a model to predict the completion rate of undergradute students at universities who complete their degree in four years or less than four years. The data being used is the [CollegeScoreCard dataset](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/) from the U.S. Department of Education. The predictive model will be built using the tool [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/).
