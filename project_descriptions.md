**Project Title:** Twitter Political Sentiment

**Solo Dolo**:
- Kahlil Wehmeyer

This app was created with the intention of getting a better understanding of the sentiment towards and surronding presedential candidates of the 2020 election for the Unites States of America.

This app is, in a way, tracking the candidate popularity. Favorite and retweet counts are a somewhat reasonable measure of how the public feels about a candidates message.

**Undergraduate Completion Rates:** Jarrod Merriman

The purpose of this project is to build a model to predict the completion rate of undergradute students at universities who complete their degree in four years or less than four years. The data being used is the [CollegeScoreCard dataset](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/) from the U.S. Department of Education. The predictive model will be built using the tool [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/).

**Project Title:** Relocation Station

**Team**:
- Natalie Brum
- Erich Grennan-Mengore

This project aimed to help a new Data Science graduate find the best city to relocate based on economic factors like cost of living and average salary as well as natural factors like the climate and the natural disasters in an area. 

**Data Sources**:

- Cost Of Living 2018 - [Numbeo.com] (https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/) - Cost of Living Data for 2018 obtained by Professor Sanchez-Arias from numbeo.com, which was retrieved from github.
- 2016 Regional Price Parity and Per Capita Personal Income - [BEA.gov] (https://www.bea.gov/) - Regional price parity, and Per Capita Personal Income in 2016 compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis(BEA)
- Natural Disaster Map - [thereadystore.com] (https://www.thereadystore.com/) - Natural Disaster Locations, the data found here was manually entered into csv format.
- R Packages such as Geonames and GSODR 

**Final Product**:

Will be a [Shiny Apps](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)

**Sleep Study**

**Team**: 
- Luke Rhon 
- Marc Burstein
- Kenneth Williams

The main goal of this project is to build a predictive model that predicts student sleep behavior or performance based on input values. Using the findings from the 2012 study we can test those results
by creating a model. Our findings so far have been trying to identify variables for our Linear Regression Models. Although we established the main variables for each regression model it doesnt explain
most of the variance. The next step was trying out Decision Trees to see if we can increase the predictive power. We have the models made but we still have to investigate the accuracy and do some fine
tuning.

# Forecasting Florida Incarceration Trends
Team: Jordan Douglass and Oliver Bennett

The initial goal of the project between Oliver and I was to measure and reflect upon healthcare in the Florida Prison Systems; unfortunately, Florida does not require a lot of data reporting in terms of healthcare for inmates.

That being explained, we began correlating the incarceration data, recidivism rates and social determinants of health between the years 2012-2017 for all counties in the state of Florida. Some of the social determinants included have been graduation rates, median household income, race and children in poverty. In our data exploration, we found many correlations within counties for these determinants and have been creating forecasting models using linear regression to determine what the next five years may look like for these specific couties given this data and how rates may be impacted if the data changed. For example, a question we are asking is, will Polk County have lower incarceration rates if the graduation rate goes up?

Upon creation of the static regression models, we hope that we may be able to create a web application that can be more insightful and interactive for users.
