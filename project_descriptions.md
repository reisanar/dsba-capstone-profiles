###Undergraduate Completion Rates:  Jarrod Merriman

The purpose of this project is to build a model to predict the completion rate of undergradute students at universities who complete their degree in four years or less than four years. The data being used is the [CollegeScoreCard dataset](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/) from the U.S. Department of Education. The predictive model will be built using the tool [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/).
